        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas
          does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively
          use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood
          sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of
          uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of
          the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.

        <h2>Type 2 diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          Type 2 diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent, or
          adult-onset) results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin. More
          than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. This type of
          diabetes is largely the result of excess body weight and physical
          inactivity.

        <h2>Type 1 diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or
          childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and
          requires daily administration of insulin. Neither its cause nor the
          means to prevent it are known. Symptoms include excessive excretion of
          urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss,
          vision changes, and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly.

        <h2>Gestational diabetes</h2>
        <p>
          Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above
          normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes
          occurs during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes are at an
          increased risk of complications during pregnancy and at delivery.
          These women and possibly their children are also at increased risk of
          type 2 diabetes in the future. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed
          through prenatal screening, rather than through reported symptoms.

        <h2>Health tips</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.</li>
          <li>
            Be physically active – doing at least 30 minutes of regular,
            moderate-intensity activity on most days. More activity is required
            for weight control.
          </li>
          <li>Eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats.</li>
          <li>
            Avoid tobacco use – smoking increases the risk of diabetes and
            cardiovascular disease.
