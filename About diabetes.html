    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or 
        when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. 
        Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads
        to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.<br/></p>

    <h2>Type 2 diabetes</h2>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes (formerly called non-insulin-dependent, or adult-onset) results from the body’s ineffective use 
        of insulin. More than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes is largely the result 
        of excess body weight and physical inactivity.<br/></p>

    <h2>Type 1 diabetes</h2>
    <p>Type 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by 
        deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. Neither its cause nor the means 
        to prevent it are known. Symptoms include excessive excretion of urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), 
        constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes, and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly.<br/></p>

    <h2>Gestational diabetes</h2>
    <p>Gestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes. 
        Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of 
        complications during pregnancy and at delivery. These women and possibly their children are also at increased 
        risk of type 2 diabetes in the future. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed through prenatal screening, rather than 
        through reported symptoms.<br/></p>

    <h2>To help delay type 2 diabetes and its complications, people should:</h2>
    <p>1. Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight<br/>
        2. Be physically active – doing at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most days. 
        More activity is required for weight control<br/>
        3. Eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats<br/>
        4. Avoid tobacco use – smoking increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease</p>
