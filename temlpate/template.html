        <p>
          Diabetes Health Tracker is a platform built to assist diabetes
          patients and their doctors to record relevant data and monitor health
          status. This platform bridges connections between patients and
          doctors.<br /><br />
          For patients, they can record and update their diabetes-related health
          data on a daily basis. These index include blood glucose level,
          weight, doses of insulin intake, and step count. Patient are also
          encouraged to write comment on any of these index to the doctor.
          <br /><br />
          On the other hand, doctors can monitor patient’s health status by
          viewing the data and comments uploaded by the patients. Doctors will
          enter the safe threshold for each index and the system will emphasize
          on index fallen out of the safe boundary. Doctors will also write
          support messages to patient on a daily basis in order to encourage
          patient to record.

          Besides, this platform also aims to provide support and encoragement
          to diabetes patients. This is achieved by the briged communication
          between doctors and patients as doctors are encouraged to write a
          “support message” for their patients. <br /><br />
          On the other hand, the “leader board” also encourages patient to
          record their data through displaying the top-5 most engaging users.
          The enaging rate is calculated by the completion percentage of evey
          day's data record.
